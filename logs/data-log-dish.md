# Data log — Dish

Project 2, MDE Studio ("AI-Augmented Storytelling with Data" · Natural + Artificial).
Running plain-language log of every data step Dish runs with Claude. This log feeds the Algorithmic Forensics Appendix.
Gina keeps her own log; the two may be combined later.

**Datasets in this log:** METAR visibility · gridMET actual temperature · UTCI felt heat
**Cities (10):** Bakersfield CA · Fresno CA · Los Angeles CA · Fairbanks AK · Eugene OR · Brownsville TX · Detroit MI · Pittsburgh PA · San Francisco CA · Boston MA
**Study period:** 2016-01-01 – 2026-09-26, daily · **Heat baseline:** 1991–2020
**Scale:** city limits. Expanded only when a dataset can't resolve the city, and logged when it is.

## Rules
1. One step at a time. Claude explains the step and shows the script, and Dish approves before it runs.
2. Raw downloads in `data/raw/` are never edited. Every change writes a new file to `data/processed/`.
3. Every step saves its exact script to `scripts/<dataset>/NN_<step-name>.py` and gets an entry below.
4. Any threshold, filter or default Dish didn't specify is flagged as **Claude's choice, approved by Dish** or **changed by Dish**.

## Entry format
Step · dataset · date · who ran it | What (plain language) | Why | Input file(s) | Script | Rows/values in → out (and what was removed or changed) | Output file | Judgment calls

### Step 0 · setup · 2026-09-27 · Dish + Claude
- **What:** Created the folder layout (`data/raw/metar/`, `data/processed/metar/`, `scripts/metar/`, `logs/`) and started this log. Added empty `.gitkeep` files so git tracks the empty folders.
- **Why:** Gives raw data, processed data, scripts and the log each a fixed place, so every change can be traced.
- **Input / output:** none (setup only) · **Script:** none (folder setup only)
- **Judgment calls:**
  - Layout proposed in the handoff doc. **Approved by Dish.**
  - Log named `data-log-dish.md` rather than `data-log.md`, because Dish and Gina keep separate logs for now. **Claude's choice, following Dish's decision to keep logs separate.**
